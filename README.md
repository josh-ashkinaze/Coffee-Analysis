# Coffee-Analysis

In this analysis, I took a look at 1000+ coffee reviews. 

[Read my blog](https://www.joshash.space/data-science/the-most-important-aspect-of-coffee) for a write-up, and look at the ipynb notebook for analysis! 

## My Questions

* Which aspect of coffee is most important for assigning an overall rating?

* Which countries receive overall ratings better than their component ratings would predict?

To answer these questions, I use exploratory analysis and a heteroskedasticity-robust fixed effect OLS model. 

## My Findings

* The most important coffee qualities are flavor, aftertaste, and balance. These are the qualities that are most predictive of overall coffee rating.

* Everyone should try Vietnmanese or Burundi coffee. Coffee from these two countries recieves an overall rating above what its component ratings would predict.
