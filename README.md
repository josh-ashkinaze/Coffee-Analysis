# coffee-analysis

In this analysis, I took a look at 1000+ coffee reviews. I answer two research questions:

1. Which aspect of coffee is most important for assigning an overall rating?

2. Which countries receive overall ratings better than their component ratings would predict?

To answer these questions, I use exploratory analysis and econometrics modeling. 

My findings: 

First, the most important coffee qualities are flavor, aftertaste, and balance. These are the qualities that are most predective of overall coffee rating.

Second, everyone should try Vietnmanese or Burundi coffee. Coffee from these two countries recieves an overall rating above what its component ratings would predict.
